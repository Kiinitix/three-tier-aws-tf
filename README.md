Three-tier architecture is a software application architecture that divides the application into three logical tiers:

    Presentation tier: This tier is responsible for displaying data to the user and accepting user input. It typically includes a web browser, a user interface (UI) framework, and a presentation layer.
    Application tier: This tier is responsible for processing business logic and data. It typically includes an application server, a database server, and an application layer.
    Data tier: This tier is responsible for storing and retrieving data. It typically includes a database server and a data layer.

The three tiers are connected by a network, and they can be located on the same server or on different servers.

Three-tier architecture has several advantages over other types of software architectures, such as two-tier architecture and client/server architecture. These advantages include:

    Scalability: Three-tier architecture is scalable because each tier can be scaled independently. For example, if the presentation tier becomes overloaded, more servers can be added to the presentation tier without affecting the application tier or the data tier.
    Reliability: Three-tier architecture is more reliable than other types of software architectures because each tier can be isolated from the other tiers. If one tier fails, the other tiers can continue to operate.
    Security: Three-tier architecture is more secure than other types of software architectures because each tier can be protected from the other tiers. For example, the data tier can be protected from the application tier and the presentation tier.

Three-tier architecture is a popular software architecture for a wide variety of applications, including web applications, enterprise applications, and mobile applications.
